This module adds several color pickers to the admin settings. They allow CMS users to adjust the colors of different areas of their site without requiring developer intervention.

## Installation

To install this module, you can do so with Composer:

```
composer require silverstripe/theme-colorpicker
```

## Usage

### Enabling

By default the theme color picker is enabled, to disable it you can adjust your YAML configuration. E.g. in
`app/_config/config.yml`:

```yml
SilverStripe\SiteConfig\SiteConfig:
  enable_theme_color_picker: false
```

### Adjusting/adding colors

Colorpicker is already supported by the [Watea](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp-watea-theme) and [Bambusa](https://github.com/silverstripe/bambusa-theme) themes and will work out of the box.

The theme colors are all configurable, so via YAML configuration you can adjust existing colors or add new ones to
the theme color picker. see `ColorpickerSiteConfigExtension.theme_colors` for a list of the default colors.

```yml
SilverStripe\SiteConfig\SiteConfig:
  theme_colors:
    # Edit existing pink color
    pink:
      Color: '#C12099'
    # Add new brown color
    brown:
      Title: 'Brown'
      CSSClass: 'brown'
      Color: '#594116'
```

Now you can add the matching color to your SCSS. Assuming your project is using a custom theme which imports Wātea's
`main.scss` file, create a `$custom-theme-colors` as follows:

```scss
// themes/customtheme/scss/main.scss

// Ensure this variable is set before importing watea scss
$custom-theme-colors: (
  'pink': #C12099, // Adjusting existing pink color
  'brown': #594116 // Adding new brown color
);

@import '../../../watea/src/scss/main';
```

For more information on using customisable theme colors in the Wātea theme, please refer to the CWP
Developer documentation: [Using the Wātea theme](https://github.com/silverstripe/cwp/blob/master/docs/en/01_Working_with_projects/14_Using_the_Watea_theme.md).
